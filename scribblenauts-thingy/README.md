ok, so in scribblenauts (both unlimited and unmasked), there are special items (presumably used for testing stuff) that you can't normally access.

now people have figured out how to patch it back in with a simple hex modification

i wanted to make a simple patcher to do it, because why not

all you need is python

put in the game folder and run the script

use patchunlimited for unlimited and patchunmasked for unmasked

(unmasked patcher should work but i can't test it cuz i don't own the game on steam)

(also an xdelta (only for unlimited) for those people)
