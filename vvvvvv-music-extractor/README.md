extracts the VVVVVV's music from the vvvvvvmusic.vvv file stored in data.zip
requires java
run the below commands in cmd
```
javac vvvvvv-music-extractor.java
java vvvvvv-music-extractor.java
```
i might update this to extract the file directly from data.zip but for now you have to put the file in the same folder as the .java file

same thing with the mmmmmmod-music-extractor.java and the mmmmmm.vvv file that comes with the [MMMMMM remixes](https://souleyedigitalmusic.bandcamp.com/album/mmmmmm) but why would you do that, you literally get the songs with the mod
